It introduces a small number of minor new features and a large number of even smaller bug fixes.\nMany changes are being introduced regarding NPCs: Combine soldiers will no longer stand in a T-pose when using pistols; shooting animations from the rocket launcher have also been added for them, and for the Resistance, in addition to rocket launcher shooting animations, animations for the crossbow have been introduced. Now, Kleiner, Eli, Magnusson, Mossman, and Breen can be given weapons upon spawning. A hacked Resistance mine has been added to the spawn menu, and numerous Lua functions for NPCs have been implemented.\nSome graphical improvements have been introduced for the Water shader, thanks to one of which the 3D skybox is reflected in the water on gm_construct. The Lightmapped_4WayBlend shader has been implemented for brushes, which allows blending up to 4 images in a texture.\nThe display of non-Latin characters in fonts used in Sandbox has been improved. The console command sv_pause_sp has been added, which allows not pausing the server in single-player mode. The face poser now has a button that allows setting random values for each category of facial elements.\nDespite the voluminous list of various changes, additions, and improvements, this update is inferior to the previous one in significance—which is quite expected. The introduction of Counter-Strike: Source content was such an important event that only a full port of the game to x64 could surpass it. Nevertheless, the game continues to get better, and the changes in the November update contribute to that.\n","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fifth-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Brief summary on Ordinary November Update of 2025","title":"Ordinary November Update 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/local-matter/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Local Matter","type":"tags"},{"content":" Dear Alium members, another year has come to an end. This year has been filled with both joyful and sad events. A lot of important news has been announced both in Alium and in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod itself.\nAlthough nothing may change next year, it is important to say that we should not shy away from the opportunity to make next year as memorable as possible in a good way.\nToday, as per our good old tradition, we will be posting a video with an annual report of all the news that happened in Alium. This video was created with your support, for which we are grateful.\nHappy New Year, dear friends!

On December 5, the map ttt_null_rpg_v1 was finally published on Steam Workshop.\nOf course, there were some difficulties in creating the map, mainly due to the lack of experience with Hammer Editor among most of the team, but after some time, this problem was solved. The map is not a complex project, as it took 25 days to create (although it could have been done in two weeks), and was made primarily for Trouble in Terrorist Town events in local circles.\nThe map is essentially a closed, looped system with three rooms and one large tunnel diagonally across the map. Each sector was created by a separate member of Polygon 53 and has a different color scheme and atmosphere. In other words, they can be considered liminal spaces.\nttt_null_rpg_v1 — Map on Steam Workshop\n","date":"7 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/07-12-23/","section":"Posts","summary":"The release of TTT Null RPG","title":"The Alium people are once again suffering from nonsense and doing incomprehensible things","type":"posts"},{"content":"Have been a gaming analytics since 2015.

Essentially, this is the same calculation from PORiPAK, but it will be a marathon covering all publications that will take place after significant changes in the balance of the game mode itself.\nWill there be a repeat of PORiPAK? — Possibly, in a few months. One of the PORiPAK publications made it to the TOP of the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod workshop, which provided a nice boost to its statistics.\n","date":"3 October 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/second-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Completion of PORiPAK CSS","title":"Completion of PORiPAK CSS","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
