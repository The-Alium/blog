Community members are talented people who write reports based on game topics, make analytical videos and machinimas, write reviews, create and modify gamemodes, create maps, organize tournaments, and participate in them.\nThe Alium Сommunity has a large documented legacy in the form of publications in the workshop, analytical or funny videos on YouTube, as well as numerous posts in discussions and announcements in the Steam group. The structure of the group is defined by detailed, actual concepts and divides the community into units. «HOW TO PLAY WITH YOU?» # “HOW TO PLAY WITH YOU?” : To play with us, you can join our events simply through the server browser. To receive notifications about when the game starts, just go to the community\u0026rsquo;s Discord server and pay attention to the notifications in the #events channel.\n«HOW DO I JOIN YOU?» # “HOW DO I JOIN YOU?” : Official membership in the group begins after your application to the Steam group has been approved. To join the group, you need 100 hours in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod, an open and presentable profile, no connections to persona non grata, and no blocks on the general ban list. Once accepted, you will be able to attend meetings, participate in tournaments, comment on posts, vote on community sanctions, etc. For more information, please contact the technical account.\n«HOW TO GET UNBANED?» # “HOW TO GET UNBANED?” : The group has a rule that if a player has been permanently banned on our friends\u0026rsquo; servers, this ban is automatically transferred to The Alium community and recognized as valid. You can get the ban lifted by negotiating with the server that banned you or by paying a fine directly to The Alium community.

As is tradition, we are publishing a video report on what happened in the community during this time. The year 2025 was marked by the formation of three units within The Alium Community: Starry Steam, Renaissance, and the external division Pika Software. YouTube rolled out multi-language audio feature, making it possible to revive Starry Steam and produce videos in multiple languages. Another stage of the community’s Anglicization also took place in 2025: all current concepts and announcements received official English translations. Earlier, current concepts had also been codified and simplified.\nIn 2025, The Alium Community collectively logged hundreds of hours in Garry’s Mod. I hope you were part of this wonderful time, and that we’ll see each other again in 2026.

It introduces a small number of minor new features and a large number of even smaller bug fixes.\nMany changes are being introduced regarding NPCs: Combine soldiers will no longer stand in a T-pose when using pistols; shooting animations from the rocket launcher have also been added for them, and for the Resistance, in addition to rocket launcher shooting animations, animations for the crossbow have been introduced. Now, Kleiner, Eli, Magnusson, Mossman, and Breen can be given weapons upon spawning. A hacked Resistance mine has been added to the spawn menu, and numerous Lua functions for NPCs have been implemented.\nSome graphical improvements have been introduced for the Water shader, thanks to one of which the 3D skybox is reflected in the water on gm_construct. The Lightmapped_4WayBlend shader has been implemented for brushes, which allows blending up to 4 images in a texture.\nThe display of non-Latin characters in fonts used in Sandbox has been improved. The console command sv_pause_sp has been added, which allows not pausing the server in single-player mode. The face poser now has a button that allows setting random values for each category of facial elements.\nDespite the voluminous list of various changes, additions, and improvements, this update is inferior to the previous one in significance—which is quite expected. The introduction of Counter-Strike: Source content was such an important event that only a full port of the game to x64 could surpass it. Nevertheless, the game continues to get better, and the changes in the November update contribute to that.\nOfficial post in the Community Hub Full changelog on the Facepunch website DenDi85 retains authorship of the article\n","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-7-ordinary-november-update-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"One can confidently say that the update from November 12, 2025, for Garry’s Mod will be the last one this year.","title":"Ordinary November Update 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/erick_maksimets/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Erick_maksimets","type":"authors"},{"content":" Hello, you are reading a text written by Erick_Maksimets, and I have returned for the second time. I would like to make a couple of changes and outline some modifications to the group that are gradually coming into effect with my new officer term.\nFor the first time in the Alium community, in October 2025, we are seeing a management situation where the community has formed three divisions: Starry Steam, Renaissance, and Pika Software as an external division with a special status. Now, to make changes in the group, we need the consent of at least two officers from the existing divisions. Overall, this situation could serve as an interesting experiment and a practical test of the community-building concepts, which described the rules of conduct in such a situation quite concisely, and it also looks like an endgame before the end of the world and an inspiring beginning at the same time.\nNow, at meetings, we will be evaluating the polarization of controversial opinions. If you used to attend meetings to have talking heads tell you interesting things about Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod while you were cooking in the kitchen, you can now approach the computer for a minute to cast a vote and, based on that vote, determine the community\u0026rsquo;s opinion.\nWe have made quite a few cosmetic changes to the Discord server and are also experimenting with its appearance there. Before that, we updated the posts in the Hudson Archive. Soon, we will try to implement the concept of a warning system into the community rules.\nBefore this, we had a lot of interesting events happen over the past couple of months. Especially in August, which marked the seventh anniversary of the creation of the first community server, but the August events, as is tradition, were remembered for a cheater who was once in a moderator position with us, trying to clear his name and, having gained our trust, unexpectedly and honestly held a tournament for his game mode — Serious Deathmatch. But that is already old news, so it\u0026rsquo;s better to talk about work.\nThe work of the Old Steam division will be focused on presenting the results in the form of videos on my channel. If you are interested in digging into topics that are not very gaming-related yet but are connected to me, you can watch my latest video. My videos here will usually be attached to St. Steam\u0026rsquo;s project works. The videos will be released in Ukrainian, Russian, and English.\nVideo about the return on the Erick_Maksimets channel\n","date":"13 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-6-starry-steams-october/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hello, you are reading a text written by Erick_Maksimets, and I have returned for the second time.","title":"Starry Steam's October","type":"posts"},{"content":" Today, a mid-sized update is being released for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod, which brings one particularly surprising change.\nWith the July update, content from Counter-Strike: Source as well as Half-Life 2: Episode One and Episode Two is now included in the game by default. This means that add-ons which previously relied on models, textures, or sounds from these games no longer require you to install them separately from your Steam library or use third-party resources. However, not all content from Counter-Strike: Source and the Episodes is bundled with Garry’s Mod. For example, voice lines, music, and maps from those games will still be missing. To access the full content, you will still need to install or purchase the respective games from Steam.\nIn addition to improving the game\u0026rsquo;s self-sufficiency, other changes have been made to various gameplay aspects. For instance, the player models for the Metrocop and Elite Terrorist have been tweaked. First-person weapon viewmodels now inherit lighting from the weapons themselves. The physics gun beam range has been increased from 8,000 to 32,000 units.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the update also fixes long-standing bugs and introduces some quality-of-life improvements. For example, previously, disabling voice chat with the command voice_enable 0 made it impossible to re-enable it with voice_enable 1. That has now been fixed. A new launch parameter -mountcfgfile was added, allowing the use of any other .cfg file from the same folder instead of mount.cfg. The lights.rad file has been updated to the Half-Life 2 HDR and Episodes version. AI node limits have been increased from 4,096 to 8,192, and the maximum number of model skins has been raised from 32 to 64. Several Lua functions have been added or updated, mainly those related to players, networking, and color.\nThe July update is striking for its inclusion of Counter-Strike: Source and Episode content. While not strictly necessary for Garry’s Mod and its sandbox to function, it addresses a major limitation for many add-ons and servers that typically rely on those assets due to the base game’s limited content. Now, ordinary players no longer need to install multiple games just to play one. As a result, missing textures and those notorious “ERROR” signs will appear far less often.\nFull changelog available on the official developer devblog Official post in the Community Hub DenDi85 retains authorship of the article\n","date":"23 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-5-delicious-july-2025-update-for-garrys-mod/","section":"Posts","summary":"Today, a mid-sized update is being released for Garry’s Mod, which brings one particularly surprising change.","title":"Delicious July 2025 Update for Garry's Mod","type":"posts"},{"content":" With the beginning of the anglicization process of the Alium community, there arose a need to translate announcements and current concepts in the Steam group.

The NPC tab now includes hacked and harmless ball mines, as well as a hostile rebel, which serves as an example for developers. At the request of the developers, Klaus Veen\u0026rsquo;s Treason has been integrated, allowing content from their game to be embedded in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod. A button has been added to the console that enables the technical display of various elements, such as the game interface.\nFor developers, the toolkit has been expanded with 14 new entities, and 4 entities have been updated, most of which were taken from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2. Numerous changes related to shaders and sounds have been introduced. In the Hammer Editor, the limit for brushes has been increased from 16,384 to 65,535, and some commands for the compiler have been added. Now, by default, all content from the \u0026ldquo;addons\u0026rdquo; folder is mounted in the Hammer Editor and can be disabled with the command \u0026ldquo;-noaddons.\u0026rdquo; One of the most significant technical changes in the entire March update is the restoration of the \u0026ldquo;JellyFish\u0026rdquo; shader.\nThis is not the complete list of changes in the March update.

People who can shape it into a clear concept with distinct elements and have the ability to bring these concepts to life are extremely valuable to the gaming industry. Unfortunately, the loss of such a talented specialist, who could not only see the big picture but also realize it in the finest details, becomes an irreplaceable loss for a very large number of people.\nOn February 16, 2025, the news of the death of Viktor Antonov, the lead art designer of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, and the designer behind Counter-Strike: Source, became known. This was initially reported by Eschatology Entertainment, a company co-founded by Viktor Antonov. The company made a post on LinkedIn confirming his death on February 9, without specifying the cause. Eschatology Entertainment stated that they are still awaiting official documents. Many other developers also expressed their condolences and shared their experiences working with Antonov in the comments to the post or on their social media, including Marc Laidlaw, who shared a story on Instagram.\nViktor Antonov\u0026rsquo;s work was confined to one industry in which he always excelled—art design. Through his unique vision, rooted in industrialization and the architecture of Eastern Europe, Half-Life 2 acquired a magnificently fitting aesthetic that we still draw upon when creating content in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod.\nWhile many people may not have known Antonov personally, he made a significant contribution and left a vast legacy that is present before our eyes every day.\nPC Gamer article Eschatology Entertainment publication on LinkedIn LambdaGeneration publication with a screenshot of Mark Laidlaw\u0026rsquo;s story DenDi85 retains authorship of the article\n","date":"17 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-2-the-death-of-viktor-antonov/","section":"Posts","summary":"The artistic design of a game is crucial for creating its atmosphere and influences the player’s perception.","title":"The death of Viktor Antonov","type":"posts"},{"content":" More than a year and a half ago, in June 2023, Meetric began from scratch the development and rethinking of his previous addon that added dynamic water.

On November 16th, 2024, Half-Life 2 will celebrate it\u0026rsquo;s 20th anniversary, and Valve is following a similar celebration plan.\nA global update has been released for Half-Life 2, changing a large number of things. Now, Half-Life 2, all episodes, and Lost Coast have been combined into one game and can be selected from the main menu. Developer commentary has been added, along with support for the Workshop.

Half-Life 2: Deathmatch has also received some \u0026ldquo;Quality of life\u0026rdquo; fixes, and a complete list of changes is available on a special website dedicated to this event.\nA new, expanded print edition of Half-Life 2: Raising The Bar has been announced.

Today, we can announce that the game mode is complete, marking its official release in the Steam Workshop.\nThe history of the JailBreak game concept in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod has not seen any successful, long-term implementations. This is evident from the low popularity of this mode in the public server browser, which is more than understandable. There is no standard for this mode that follows a Plug and Play principle. The best version of JailBreak in the workshop until now was a release by user Clark, who created it back in 2017 for the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod Gamemode Competition hosted by GmodStore.\nThere is no doubt that if Unknown Developer had participated in that competition, he could have walked away with prize money, but this version of JailBreak is being released as an independent publication.\nPreviously, a classic version of JailBreak was attempted by Minerva officer Bilwin, but no public results from that effort exist; all developments remained with the developer and have likely not been used anywhere since 2022.\nReferring to the evaluation of game modes by RoboKnife, the newly released version of JailBreak does not stand out for its single-player features or competitiveness. This can be explained by the fact that the game mode is entirely designed for friendly interaction among players; there is little for solo players to engage with. However, this does not mean that the mode does not serve as an example for others. On the contrary, the game mode is exemplary in many other aspects.\nJailBreak: Unknown\u0026rsquo;s Cut - Gamemode in the workshop\n","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/release-of-jailbreak-unknowns-cut/","section":"Posts","summary":"JailBreak: Unknown’s Cut release on Workshop","title":"Release of JailBreak: Unknown's Cut","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/s8cli/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"S8cli","type":"authors"},{"content":" Dear Alium members, another year has come to an end.

However, after some time, this issue was resolved. The map is not a complex project, as its creation took 25 days (although it could have been completed in two weeks) and was primarily designed for events related to Trouble in Terrorist Town within local circles.\nThe map essentially represents a closed, looping system with three rooms and one large tunnel running diagonally across the map.

However, there are plans to potentially release a separate version of the map for PVP, which could be played in other modes.\nAll the intended aspects of the map have been successfully implemented, making it ready for play.

Analyzing the long-term consequences of the events related to the Soripov Plan, both negative and positive changes can be noted two years after the plan\u0026rsquo;s conclusion and the release of a video on how developers confront the community.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to point out that the issue of low-quality guides remains and has even worsened. This is not specifically related to Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod players; it is a general trend across all Steam games. From this perspective, the foundation of the plan\u0026rsquo;s idea has failed, as the rules were meant to promote quality content in the guides section and filter out poor content. There is still a lot of bad content and a significant amount of meme posts. This is a problem.\nOn the other hand, when analyzing the long-term effects on the guide rules, a positive trend can be observed. Over the past year, the rule prohibiting the use of the secret phrase \u0026ldquo;Bloxwich\u0026rdquo; in achievements was removed. This is the only positive change, bringing the total number of rules down to three, which unfortunately are still not being enforced.\nRubat, the sole developer of the game, currently faces mixed criticism from both players and developers. It is unlikely that we can expect more effective management of the rules from him in the near future. However, a future update is expected to be decent due to the changes that have emerged in the beta branch before October.\nThe Soripov Protocol, two years after the conclusion of the plan, will be published as a separate discussion in the Hudson Archive.\nRules, servers, and workshop in 2023 — Publication in the community on YouTube Soripov Protocol — Publication in the Hudson Archive\n","date":"15 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/two-years-after-the-soripov-plan/","section":"Posts","summary":"Analysis of the consequences of the SORIP plan","title":"Two Years After the Soripov Plan","type":"posts"},{"content":" Every Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod player has at least once encountered such an item as a Toolgun, a universal thing that no game session can be complete without. Of course, players had a lot of questions about the functions of this tool, but still, few people asked themselves who is the creator of the Toolgun model that has been present in the game since 2005.\nDav0r (Dave Hunt) is an old member of the community who created many models, half of which were later included in the original version of the game. Toolgun, dynamite, hoverball, camera and many other models were created by this modeler. Dav0r was a rather open personality and left behind a large online footprint in the form of his Twitter, Twitch and Artstation accounts. Until recently, his personality was not so popular until the news of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s death was released on the official Discord server of Facepunch on Saturday, the sixteenth. Surprisingly, a day after the news broke, his friend Richter Overtime posted on Twitter that he had been trying to contact Dav0r for a year, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t responded.\nDave Hunt retained the authorship of many models, half of which were later used by Harry Newman in the development of the game. According to some of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s acquaintances, he was a rather positive and calm person who was not noticed in toxic behavior\nHis death brought him popularity not only in the English-speaking community, but also in the Russian-speaking community. Before this news, most users did not even know about Dav0r as a model creator, let alone his personality.

This event could have been just another unremarkable occurrence; however, that day was destined to become significant in the history of the Alium community due to heated discussions and the resonance of the situation.\nBy the evening, towards the end of the event, it was established that s4molet1k had an unfair advantage over other players by using cheating programs or files that assisted with aiming and provided the exact locations of other players on the map. After presenting evidence and having a clarifying conversation in a private chat with s4molet1k, all of his rights as an official and organizer were revoked. In an attempt to rehabilitate himself, he submitted a request for restoration to be removed from the general ban list by paying a fine, but it was ultimately rejected due to the high amounts involved. Following the restoration review, a sanction was created to block his request, which did not take effect immediately due to a lack of necessary votes.\nAs a result, the Alium community lost an organizer, an official, and a potential developer. The reputation of s4molet1k plummeted, and numerous disputes arose within the Alium community regarding the position of his friend Raineronus 7-8 in the group. Questions also emerged about who should bear responsibility, the necessity of punishing Polygon officer Gunter, and the future of the division itself. Unfortunately, this event left the Polygon division in a dire state, with only one moderator and officer remaining.\nThree weeks after the main events, on the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch server run by Flammable, better known by his real name—Mikhail Belyaev—s4molet1k was caught cheating again. This incident reached the Alium community, reigniting the excitement around the situation, but this time it extended beyond Garry’s Mod. Following this, a renewed community sanction was written to block the restoration request, which was successful, and the fine for unbanning was increased. Just two days later, Flammable released a video dedicated to both s4molet1k and the entire situation, revealing all the details of his bans in three hours.\nHacks ruined his life — Video by Mikhail Belyaev on YouTube Recovery check for s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive First community sanction on s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive Second community sanction on s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive\n","date":"27 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/august-will-be-remembered-for-cheating-and-mikhail-belyaev/","section":"Posts","summary":"Incredible detective story about cheating and betrayal","title":"August Will Be Remembered for Cheating and Mikhail Belyaev","type":"posts"},{"content":" Recently, a group of mappers from Alium completed their project work on creating a community map intended for testing the skills of candidates for active roles. Initially, the map was conceived as less absurd, but as the level of madness increased during development, it turned into a map filled with local humor that would deter any random players from attempting to complete it.\nYesterday, all major work on the map was either completed or put on hold, so the project work on the map development is considered finished.\nThe preparation took a lot of time due to the recruitment of mappers and the establishment of standards starting from the end of April. By the beginning of May, the map was already in development and was released to celebrate the community\u0026rsquo;s five-year anniversary. In total, three months were spent on the project.\nAlium Course — Map in the workshop Fifth anniversary of the Alium community — Announcement in the group\n","date":"7 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/alium-course-as-another-community-map/","section":"Posts","summary":"Release of gm_alium_course","title":"Alium Course as Another Community Map","type":"posts"},{"content":" Five years have passed since the creation of the first Alium server, the opening of which marked the beginning of the well-known Alium story. In reality, there are no exact dates for the community\u0026rsquo;s emergence, as it was not a one-time unilateral decision made by some ephemeral community manager. It can be assumed that the players of AliumGM, who were friends of Yaroslav, the creator of the first Alium server, represented some sort of unorganized group of friends even before the server opened. However, this is largely irrelevant now, as their decisions do not impact the current or future situation in Alium.\nFive years is a convenient milestone for the present, as no one has been in the community for more than five years prior to the creation of the first server. Only a few players remain from that time, and they won\u0026rsquo;t have much to share. I can only say that it was simply enjoyable for me to return to my computer in the evenings after school, university, or work to spend a few hours of my life at a chaotic party in the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod community of people I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nTo celebrate the five-year anniversary, a gathering will be organized that will bring some changes to the structure of the group. In a few days or weeks, another announcement will be made with the results of the implementation of the changes proposed at the gathering.

Despite expressions of disappointment, most users were indifferent, as the server had remained empty for a long time, and interest in the project had waned among the majority of players.\nFor several years, OctoGames occupied a gaming niche for fans of non-roleplay modes, gathering them under the community of servers from Octothorp Team. At one time, a significant number of players enjoyed OctoGames, but they have all since moved on. New players found it uninteresting. The project administration also showed little interest. As one player described the situation: \u0026ldquo;Zero updates, zero fixes, zero administrators.\u0026rdquo;\nDue to the low online presence, which only occasionally peaked on weekends, the administrators lost motivation to maintain the server. This is supported by statistics from server monitoring websites and the lack of new topics on the forum. Developers also saw no reason to support a barely alive project. Occasionally, interest in the server was rekindled thanks to updates from Wani4ka and QURS. However, after the developers left, player interest in the project nearly vanished.\nIt is worth noting that OctoGames received virtually no advertising and was little known outside the Octothorp Team community. For many, OctoGames was simply a break from Dobrogorod. Additionally, the project was uncompetitive compared to other servers due to the lack of unique elements that could keep players engaged for an extended period. The game modes were standard with only minor changes. The only thing that could briefly captivate players was ChopChop with its mechanics, but even that gameplay was only entertaining for 2-3 evenings before it quickly became tiresome.\nOctothorp Team\u0026rsquo;s forum Gunter retains authorship of the article\n","date":"16 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/octogames-has-closed/","section":"Posts","summary":"Closure of OctoGames gaming server","title":"OctoGames Has Closed","type":"posts"},{"content":" Last summer, the workshop saw changes to many popular add-ons that introduced unauthorized screamers into the game. This summer, the story is repeating itself, albeit on a smaller scale.\nAs usual, it was initially difficult to determine which add-on was triggering the screamer, but eventually, all signs pointed to the workshop publications of Albert Wesker, as all items in his workshop had updates corresponding to the morning of June 9th.\nAccording to subscribers of the workshop, the infected add-ons initiate the appearance of the screamer through a script that activates when the player moves. There is no information regarding data loss, publication of personal information, or damage to the game or computer. Subscribers to the add-ons can simply experience a fright. Strangely enough, the problem can be resolved by simply unsubscribing from the add-ons in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop.\nAlthough there is no rule in the \u0026ldquo;Our Rules\u0026rdquo; section of the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod Wiki that prohibits the addition of screamers to add-ons, Rubat has been informed about the potential violations in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop. The community is currently well aware of the changes to the add-ons due to significant media reaction.\nSteam moderators, citing Steam ToS rules, may consider such changes in an add-on as trolling and could block the workshop without any action from the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod developers.\nThe consequences could lead to a humorous reaction from the community, similar to the larger version that occurred last summer.

The spawn list has improved effect names in the texturing tab. Additionally, in the main menu, when the add-ons list is open, it will now update immediately when subscriptions change.\nThe color modification tool has been updated to include the ability to invert colors. A new ConVar, \u0026ldquo;gmod_delete_temp_files,\u0026rdquo; has been added, which will handle the deletion of the materials/temp/ and sounds/temp/ folders upon game launch and exit. An experimental change has also been implemented, completely removing the limit on the number of Lua files in single-player mode.\nThe issue of incomplete add-on loading when joining servers with more than a hundred add-ons has been fixed. The game crash caused by the premature removal of npc_manhack has been addressed. The toggle_duck command in multiplayer has been corrected, and a server crash when entering the commands sv_parallel_sendsnapshot and sv_parallel_packentities has been resolved.\nRegarding technical changes for developers, the Hammer Editor now has full support for \u0026ldquo;Static Prop Lightmap.\u0026rdquo; Each Input/Output will have its own description.

The main event was the departure of Flashar from the position of officer, followed by the disbandment of the \u0026ldquo;Center\u0026rdquo; division and the creation of the \u0026ldquo;Polygon 53\u0026rdquo; division, with Gunter as its officer.\nOn April 20th, the project work on the Monty Hall paradox in TTT conditions was completed. The results have not yet been published. Additionally, this month, the collection of icons for various maps for Pika Software was finalized.\nOn April 21st, an update for Alium Nook was released. Some areas on the map were edited to allow players to hide while playing Zombie Plague. A fix was added to prevent doors from being blocked.\nThree gatherings were held this spring: on March 30th, April 27th, and May 27th. For detailed information, you can review the transcripts in the discussions of the Hudson Archive. After the gathering on April 27th, work began on Alium Course, which is being handled by Sereganeon and SoR_Ge.\nOn May 6th, the Lakursky Court was held regarding the extension of Community Sanctions, resulting in several amendments to the concept without any deletions.\nThroughout its existence, the \u0026ldquo;Center\u0026rdquo; has achieved decent results. In 2022, a PRiPIR authored by Gunter was conducted, which resulted in the completion of the minimum planned work. On May 7th, a tournament for CSS was organized by Flashar.

Unsurprisingly, the majority of respondents voted for removal. This event is noteworthy primarily because it pertains to Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod, which is not a common topic for Garry, as his Twitter content usually revolves around S\u0026amp;Box or his personal life.\nThe following day, April 20th, Garry published another post, this time without a poll, but with a detailed explanation of the situation. In short, Garry decided to raise the issue of Nazism on certain roleplay servers, mainly those themed around World War II. He noted that there are players on such servers who, as he put it, seem to really like Nazis, and some of them appear to carry those sentiments beyond the game. He is also concerned about what this could lead to for both regular players and server owners.\nAt the end of the post, Newman stated that they would not impose total control over servers or dictate the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; thoughts to players; rather, such servers would be shut down as they had been in the past. He made an announcement to all server owners, asking how he could begin working with them to avoid potential server bans.\nAccording to Garry, he has begun to view this situation differently than he did ten years ago. He now has a daughter and a son who play games, and like him, they learn new things about the world through them. He is very concerned about what such servers might teach others. This could be a hint that rules for server owners may indeed tighten, and there will be more detailed oversight.\nIt is likely that the community will see fewer such players over time, not only on World War II servers but possibly on other large and small projects as well. These individuals not only irritate others with their antics but also behave immorally, damaging the reputation of not just the servers but the entire gaming community.\nWe may be facing some changes ahead; this issue might not only affect World War II servers but could extend to other areas as well. All we can do now is to refrain from behaving in such a manner.\nGarry Newman\u0026rsquo;s post with a survey Garry Newman\u0026rsquo;s post with explanations Sereganeon retains authorship of the article\n","date":"21 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/garry-newman-is-banning-servers-again/","section":"Posts","summary":"Garry’s Mod bans Nazi content.","title":"Garry Newman is Banning Servers Again","type":"posts"},{"content":"Recently, Valve Software unveiled a significant update for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, branding it as Counter-Strike 2. This is a unique event in the Source games, as it marks the first time (excluding Dota 2) that a game has been fully transitioned from Source to Source 2.\nThis transition sheds light on some misconceptions surrounding how game engines work and how games are ported to new versions of these engines. It is common in the community to hear the belief that no one is interested in modifying Source because its code is considered outdated. However, those who support this view often overlook the fact that there are currently very few games on the market that use the original engine. Most new engines are essentially rewritten versions of older ones.\nSource 2 is no exception to this rewriting trend. It is a new version of Source that is based on the code of the old engine, which, interestingly, was once based on GoldSrc. Observing this event can serve as a lesson for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod.\nIt is important to note that the port of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to the new engine occurred not primarily because the developers have a deep love for their game. It happened due to commercial conditions that constrained the possibility of releasing a new game in the series. Financial gain is a priority when deciding whether to port a game to a new engine or create a new game on a new engine. A similar issue has arisen with Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod 2, which is now called S\u0026amp;Box.\nAfter the release of Counter-Strike 2, we should recognize why Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod was not updated to Source 2, and instead, we are receiving a completely different game on the same engine. This is due to the absence of in-game transactions or any additional financial incentives for the developers. While the old code presents challenges for updates, it is not a fundamental barrier that should doom the game.\nThe future of updates for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod remains uncertain due to the priorities of the Facepunch developers. We can only hope that Garry Newman\u0026rsquo;s words in an interview with PC Gamer—that the game will be updated as long as people continue to play it—were not a lie.\nErick_Malsimets retains authorship of the article.\n","date":"30 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/counter-strike-2-in-the-context-of-garrys-mod-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Counter-Strike 2 engine transition explained.","title":"Counter-Strike 2 in the Context of Garry's Mod 2","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ru/tags/%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Глобальщина","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 March 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/alium/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Alium","type":"tags"},{"content":" The latest private project work of the community The Alium has come to an end.
