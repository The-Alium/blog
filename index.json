It introduces a small number of minor new features and a large number of even smaller bug fixes.\nMany changes are being introduced regarding NPCs: Combine soldiers will no longer stand in a T-pose when using pistols; shooting animations from the rocket launcher have also been added for them, and for the Resistance, in addition to rocket launcher shooting animations, animations for the crossbow have been introduced. Now, Kleiner, Eli, Magnusson, Mossman, and Breen can be given weapons upon spawning. A hacked Resistance mine has been added to the spawn menu, and numerous Lua functions for NPCs have been implemented.\nSome graphical improvements have been introduced for the Water shader, thanks to one of which the 3D skybox is reflected in the water on gm_construct. The Lightmapped_4WayBlend shader has been implemented for brushes, which allows blending up to 4 images in a texture.\nThe display of non-Latin characters in fonts used in Sandbox has been improved. The console command sv_pause_sp has been added, which allows not pausing the server in single-player mode. The face poser now has a button that allows setting random values for each category of facial elements.\nDespite the voluminous list of various changes, additions, and improvements, this update is inferior to the previous one in significance—which is quite expected. The introduction of Counter-Strike: Source content was such an important event that only a full port of the game to x64 could surpass it. Nevertheless, the game continues to get better, and the changes in the November update contribute to that.\n","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fifth-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Brief summary on Ordinary November Update of 2025","title":"Ordinary November Update 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":" ","date":"12 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"Blowfish has full support for Hugo taxonomies and will adapt to any taxonomy set up.

On December 5, the map ttt_null_rpg_v1 was ultimately published in the Steam Workshop.\nDuring the creation of the map, there were, of course, inevitable difficulties, primarily stemming from the limited experience of a large part of the team with the Hammer Editor. However, after some time, this issue was resolved. The map is not a complex project, as its creation took 25 days (although it could have been completed in two weeks) and was primarily designed for events related to Trouble in Terrorist Town within local circles.\nThe map essentially represents a closed, looping system with three rooms and one large tunnel running diagonally across the map. Each sector was created by a different member of Polygon 53 and features a distinct color palette and atmosphere. In other words, these can be considered liminal spaces.\nttt_null_rpg_v1 — Map in Workshop\n","date":"7 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/alium-members-are-once-again-engaging-in-nonsense/","section":"Posts","summary":"The release of TTT Null RPG","title":"Alium Members Are Once Again Engaging in Nonsense...

The Staryy Steam team, consisting of three developers, made significant efforts to bring this experimental concept to life within a month, focusing on battles against bots.\nIt is important to note that this map was specifically designed for PVE (player versus environment), which excludes the possibility of balanced gameplay in a standard team deathmatch. However, there are plans to potentially release a separate version of the map for PVP, which could be played in other modes.\nAll the intended aspects of the map have been successfully implemented, making it ready for play. However, further changes may be made after the first public games to improve and refine the map.\nThe importance of this project has been demonstrated by its speed, showing that three developers can create twelve Team Deathmatch maps in a year.

Analyzing the long-term consequences of the events related to the Soripov Plan, both negative and positive changes can be noted two years after the plan\u0026rsquo;s conclusion and the release of a video on how developers confront the community.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to point out that the issue of low-quality guides remains and has even worsened. This is not specifically related to Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod players; it is a general trend across all Steam games. From this perspective, the foundation of the plan\u0026rsquo;s idea has failed, as the rules were meant to promote quality content in the guides section and filter out poor content. There is still a lot of bad content and a significant amount of meme posts. This is a problem.\nOn the other hand, when analyzing the long-term effects on the guide rules, a positive trend can be observed. Over the past year, the rule prohibiting the use of the secret phrase \u0026ldquo;Bloxwich\u0026rdquo; in achievements was removed. This is the only positive change, bringing the total number of rules down to three, which unfortunately are still not being enforced.\nRubat, the sole developer of the game, currently faces mixed criticism from both players and developers. It is unlikely that we can expect more effective management of the rules from him in the near future. However, a future update is expected to be decent due to the changes that have emerged in the beta branch before October.\nThe Soripov Protocol, two years after the conclusion of the plan, will be published as a separate discussion in the Hudson Archive.\nRules, servers, and workshop in 2023 — Publication in the community on YouTube Soripov Protocol — Publication in the Hudson Archive\n","date":"15 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/two-years-after-the-soripov-plan/","section":"Posts","summary":"Analysis of the consequences of the SORIP plan","title":"Two Years After the Soripov Plan","type":"posts"},{"content":" Every Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod player has at least once encountered such an item as a Toolgun, a universal thing that no game session can be complete without. Of course, players had a lot of questions about the functions of this tool, but still, few people asked themselves who is the creator of the Toolgun model that has been present in the game since 2005.\nDav0r (Dave Hunt) is an old member of the community who created many models, half of which were later included in the original version of the game. Toolgun, dynamite, hoverball, camera and many other models were created by this modeler. Dav0r was a rather open personality and left behind a large online footprint in the form of his Twitter, Twitch and Artstation accounts. Until recently, his personality was not so popular until the news of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s death was released on the official Discord server of Facepunch on Saturday, the sixteenth. Surprisingly, a day after the news broke, his friend Richter Overtime posted on Twitter that he had been trying to contact Dav0r for a year, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t responded.\nDave Hunt retained the authorship of many models, half of which were later used by Harry Newman in the development of the game. According to some of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s acquaintances, he was a rather positive and calm person who was not noticed in toxic behavior\nHis death brought him popularity not only in the English-speaking community, but also in the Russian-speaking community.

This event could have been just another unremarkable occurrence; however, that day was destined to become significant in the history of the Alium community due to heated discussions and the resonance of the situation.\nBy the evening, towards the end of the event, it was established that s4molet1k had an unfair advantage over other players by using cheating programs or files that assisted with aiming and provided the exact locations of other players on the map. After presenting evidence and having a clarifying conversation in a private chat with s4molet1k, all of his rights as an official and organizer were revoked. In an attempt to rehabilitate himself, he submitted a request for restoration to be removed from the general ban list by paying a fine, but it was ultimately rejected due to the high amounts involved. Following the restoration review, a sanction was created to block his request, which did not take effect immediately due to a lack of necessary votes.\nAs a result, the Alium community lost an organizer, an official, and a potential developer. The reputation of s4molet1k plummeted, and numerous disputes arose within the Alium community regarding the position of his friend Raineronus 7-8 in the group. Questions also emerged about who should bear responsibility, the necessity of punishing Polygon officer Gunter, and the future of the division itself. Unfortunately, this event left the Polygon division in a dire state, with only one moderator and officer remaining.\nThree weeks after the main events, on the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch server run by Flammable, better known by his real name—Mikhail Belyaev—s4molet1k was caught cheating again. This incident reached the Alium community, reigniting the excitement around the situation, but this time it extended beyond Garry’s Mod. Following this, a renewed community sanction was written to block the restoration request, which was successful, and the fine for unbanning was increased. Just two days later, Flammable released a video dedicated to both s4molet1k and the entire situation, revealing all the details of his bans in three hours.\nHacks ruined his life — Video by Mikhail Belyaev on YouTube Recovery check for s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive First community sanction on s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive Second community sanction on s4molet1k — Publication in the Belyaev Archive\n","date":"27 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/august-will-be-remembered-for-cheating-and-mikhail-belyaev/","section":"Posts","summary":"Incredible detective story about cheating and betrayal","title":"August Will Be Remembered for Cheating and Mikhail Belyaev","type":"posts"},{"content":" Recently, a group of mappers from Alium completed their project work on creating a community map intended for testing the skills of candidates for active roles.

By the beginning of May, the map was already in development and was released to celebrate the community\u0026rsquo;s five-year anniversary.

In reality, there are no exact dates for the community\u0026rsquo;s emergence, as it was not a one-time unilateral decision made by some ephemeral community manager. It can be assumed that the players of AliumGM, who were friends of Yaroslav, the creator of the first Alium server, represented some sort of unorganized group of friends even before the server opened. However, this is largely irrelevant now, as their decisions do not impact the current or future situation in Alium.\nFive years is a convenient milestone for the present, as no one has been in the community for more than five years prior to the creation of the first server. Only a few players remain from that time, and they won\u0026rsquo;t have much to share. I can only say that it was simply enjoyable for me to return to my computer in the evenings after school, university, or work to spend a few hours of my life at a chaotic party in the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod community of people I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nTo celebrate the five-year anniversary, a gathering will be organized that will bring some changes to the structure of the group.

Despite expressions of disappointment, most users were indifferent, as the server had remained empty for a long time, and interest in the project had waned among the majority of players.\nFor several years, OctoGames occupied a gaming niche for fans of non-roleplay modes, gathering them under the community of servers from Octothorp Team. At one time, a significant number of players enjoyed OctoGames, but they have all since moved on. New players found it uninteresting. The project administration also showed little interest. As one player described the situation: \u0026ldquo;Zero updates, zero fixes, zero administrators.\u0026rdquo;\nDue to the low online presence, which only occasionally peaked on weekends, the administrators lost motivation to maintain the server. This is supported by statistics from server monitoring websites and the lack of new topics on the forum. Developers also saw no reason to support a barely alive project. Occasionally, interest in the server was rekindled thanks to updates from Wani4ka and QURS. However, after the developers left, player interest in the project nearly vanished.\nIt is worth noting that OctoGames received virtually no advertising and was little known outside the Octothorp Team community. For many, OctoGames was simply a break from Dobrogorod. Additionally, the project was uncompetitive compared to other servers due to the lack of unique elements that could keep players engaged for an extended period. The game modes were standard with only minor changes. The only thing that could briefly captivate players was ChopChop with its mechanics, but even that gameplay was only entertaining for 2-3 evenings before it quickly became tiresome.\nOctothorp Team\u0026rsquo;s forum Gunter retains authorship of the article\n","date":"16 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/octogames-has-closed/","section":"Posts","summary":"Closure of OctoGames gaming server","title":"OctoGames Has Closed","type":"posts"},{"content":" Last summer, the workshop saw changes to many popular add-ons that introduced unauthorized screamers into the game. This summer, the story is repeating itself, albeit on a smaller scale.\nAs usual, it was initially difficult to determine which add-on was triggering the screamer, but eventually, all signs pointed to the workshop publications of Albert Wesker, as all items in his workshop had updates corresponding to the morning of June 9th.\nAccording to subscribers of the workshop, the infected add-ons initiate the appearance of the screamer through a script that activates when the player moves. There is no information regarding data loss, publication of personal information, or damage to the game or computer. Subscribers to the add-ons can simply experience a fright. Strangely enough, the problem can be resolved by simply unsubscribing from the add-ons in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop.\nAlthough there is no rule in the \u0026ldquo;Our Rules\u0026rdquo; section of the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod Wiki that prohibits the addition of screamers to add-ons, Rubat has been informed about the potential violations in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop. The community is currently well aware of the changes to the add-ons due to significant media reaction.\nSteam moderators, citing Steam ToS rules, may consider such changes in an add-on as trolling and could block the workshop without any action from the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod developers.\nThe consequences could lead to a humorous reaction from the community, similar to the larger version that occurred last summer.

The spawn list has improved effect names in the texturing tab.
