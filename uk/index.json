It introduces a small number of minor new features and a large number of even smaller bug fixes.\nMany changes are being introduced regarding NPCs: Combine soldiers will no longer stand in a T-pose when using pistols; shooting animations from the rocket launcher have also been added for them, and for the Resistance, in addition to rocket launcher shooting animations, animations for the crossbow have been introduced. Now, Kleiner, Eli, Magnusson, Mossman, and Breen can be given weapons upon spawning. A hacked Resistance mine has been added to the spawn menu, and numerous Lua functions for NPCs have been implemented.\nSome graphical improvements have been introduced for the Water shader, thanks to one of which the 3D skybox is reflected in the water on gm_construct. The Lightmapped_4WayBlend shader has been implemented for brushes, which allows blending up to 4 images in a texture.\nThe display of non-Latin characters in fonts used in Sandbox has been improved. The console command sv_pause_sp has been added, which allows not pausing the server in single-player mode. The face poser now has a button that allows setting random values for each category of facial elements.\nDespite the voluminous list of various changes, additions, and improvements, this update is inferior to the previous one in significance—which is quite expected. The introduction of Counter-Strike: Source content was such an important event that only a full port of the game to x64 could surpass it. Nevertheless, the game continues to get better, and the changes in the November update contribute to that.\n","date":"12 листопада 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fifth-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Brief summary on Ordinary November Update of 2025","title":"Ordinary November Update 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":"Have been a gaming analytics since 2015.

All discovered maps underwent balance checks and received new designs for the Steam workshop.\nWith the completion of this plan, the Alium community now has access to a new branch of PORiPAK — the ZPB Marathon. Essentially, this is the same calculation from PORiPAK, but it will be a marathon covering all publications that will take place after significant changes in the balance of the game mode itself.\nWill there be a repeat of PORiPAK? — Possibly, in a few months. One of the PORiPAK publications made it to the TOP of the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod workshop, which provided a nice boost to its statistics.\n","date":"3 жовтня 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/second-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Completion of PORiPAK CSS","title":"Completion of PORiPAK CSS","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/uk/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/uk/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/uk/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/uk/","section":"The Alium","summary":"","title":"The Alium","type":"page"}]
