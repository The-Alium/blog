In honor of this, Valve created a special online page, released a global update for the game, and published a documentary. On November 16th, 2024, Half-Life 2 will celebrate it\u0026rsquo;s 20th anniversary, and Valve is following a similar celebration plan.\nA global update has been released for Half-Life 2, changing a large number of things. Now, Half-Life 2, all episodes, and Lost Coast have been combined into one game and can be selected from the main menu. Developer commentary has been added, along with support for the Workshop. The game content has been updated, graphics settings improved, and performance on the Steam Deck enhanced. Half-Life 2: Deathmatch has also received some \u0026ldquo;Quality of life\u0026rdquo; fixes, and a complete list of changes is available on a special website dedicated to this event.\nA new, expanded print edition of Half-Life 2: Raising The Bar has been announced. A documentary covering the entire development cycle from the creation of Half-Life 2 to the third episode, featuring archival footage such as the E3 Demo 2002, 2003, and the Free TV demo, has been released on the official YouTube channel. The official soundtrack is now available on Steam and other platforms.\nFor Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod, this means that when playing on the original maps, these improvements will also be present. Content from all three games, as well as Lost Coast, is now added after downloading Half-Life 2 on Steam. Some changes from this update may be included in a future update.\nA year ago, like Half-Life, Counter-Strike received an update that fixed and added many features. It was expected that Counter-Strike: Source would also receive some attention, as it also turned 20 years old on November 1, 2004; however, it has not received any updates.\n","date":"16 листопада 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/half-life-2s-20th-anniversary/","section":"Posts","summary":"celebration of Half-Life 2’s 20th Anniversary","title":"Half-Life 2's 20th Anniversary","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 листопада 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/news/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"News","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 листопада 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/garrys-mod-related/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Garry's Mod Related","type":"tags"},{"content":" One can confidently say that the update from November 12, 2025, for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod will be the last one this year. It introduces a small number of minor new features and a large number of even smaller bug fixes.\nMany changes are being introduced regarding NPCs: Combine soldiers will no longer stand in a T-pose when using pistols; shooting animations from the rocket launcher have also been added for them, and for the Resistance, in addition to rocket launcher shooting animations, animations for the crossbow have been introduced. Now, Kleiner, Eli, Magnusson, Mossman, and Breen can be given weapons upon spawning. A hacked Resistance mine has been added to the spawn menu, and numerous Lua functions for NPCs have been implemented.\nSome graphical improvements have been introduced for the Water shader, thanks to one of which the 3D skybox is reflected in the water on gm_construct. The Lightmapped_4WayBlend shader has been implemented for brushes, which allows blending up to 4 images in a texture.\nThe display of non-Latin characters in fonts used in Sandbox has been improved. The console command sv_pause_sp has been added, which allows not pausing the server in single-player mode. The face poser now has a button that allows setting random values for each category of facial elements.\nDespite the voluminous list of various changes, additions, and improvements, this update is inferior to the previous one in significance—which is quite expected. The introduction of Counter-Strike: Source content was such an important event that only a full port of the game to x64 could surpass it. Nevertheless, the game continues to get better, and the changes in the November update contribute to that.\n","date":"12 листопада 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/ordinary-november-update-2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"Brief summary on Ordinary November Update of 2025","title":"Ordinary November Update 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":" The artistic design of a game is crucial for creating its atmosphere and influences the player\u0026rsquo;s perception. People who can shape it into a clear concept with distinct elements and have the ability to bring these concepts to life are extremely valuable to the gaming industry. Unfortunately, the loss of such a talented specialist, who could not only see the big picture but also realize it in the finest details, becomes an irreplaceable loss for a very large number of people.\nOn February 16, 2025, the news of the death of Viktor Antonov, the lead art designer of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, and the designer behind Counter-Strike: Source, became known. This was initially reported by Eschatology Entertainment, a company co-founded by Viktor Antonov. The company made a post on LinkedIn confirming his death on February 9, without specifying the cause. Eschatology Entertainment stated that they are still awaiting official documents. Many other developers also expressed their condolences and shared their experiences working with Antonov in the comments to the post or on their social media, including Marc Laidlaw, who shared a story on Instagram.\nViktor Antonov\u0026rsquo;s work was confined to one industry in which he always excelled—art design. Through his unique vision, rooted in industrialization and the architecture of Eastern Europe, Half-Life 2 acquired a magnificently fitting aesthetic that we still draw upon when creating content in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod.\nWhile many people may not have known Antonov personally, he made a significant contribution and left a vast legacy that is present before our eyes every day.\n","date":"17 лютого 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-death-of-viktor-antonov/","section":"Posts","summary":"Death of the lead art designer of HL2 \u0026 CS:S Viktor Antonov","title":"The death of Viktor Antonov","type":"posts"},{"content":" More than a year and a half ago, in June 2023, Meetric began from scratch the development and rethinking of his previous addon that added dynamic water. For a long time, the progress of the development was regularly published on his YouTube channel, and access to the early version was provided through Patreon and Boosty. On January 11th, 2025, the final version of GWater 2 was released in the workshop.\nGWater 2 completely surpasses the previous addon in all parameters. Now liquids don\u0026rsquo;t look like a multitude of mixing squares, but like more realistic individual drops that can seamlessly merge. Performance has improved, the user interface has become more pleasant and has added sounds, and there are many settings, the ability to save presets, etc.\nWith each new demonstration of developments and publication of addons in the workshop, Meetric continues to prove himself as an extremely promising and authoritative developer. The publication of his latest magnum opus in such a short time also shows him to be an honest person who does not intend to endlessly extract money from his platforms. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that in the development of GWater 2, Meetric was assisted not only financially but also with specific contributions and code.

Today, we can announce that the game mode is complete, marking its official release in the Steam Workshop.\nThe history of the JailBreak game concept in Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod has not seen any successful, long-term implementations. This is evident from the low popularity of this mode in the public server browser, which is more than understandable. There is no standard for this mode that follows a Plug and Play principle. The best version of JailBreak in the workshop until now was a release by user Clark, who created it back in 2017 for the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod Gamemode Competition hosted by GmodStore.\nThere is no doubt that if Unknown Developer had participated in that competition, he could have walked away with prize money, but this version of JailBreak is being released as an independent publication.\nPreviously, a classic version of JailBreak was attempted by Minerva officer Bilwin, but no public results from that effort exist; all developments remained with the developer and have likely not been used anywhere since 2022.\nReferring to the evaluation of game modes by RoboKnife, the newly released version of JailBreak does not stand out for its single-player features or competitiveness. This can be explained by the fact that the game mode is entirely designed for friendly interaction among players; there is little for solo players to engage with. However, this does not mean that the mode does not serve as an example for others. On the contrary, the game mode is exemplary in many other aspects.\nJailBreak: Unknown\u0026rsquo;s Cut - Gamemode in the workshop\n","date":"4 квітня 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/release-of-jailbreak-unknowns-cut/","section":"Posts","summary":"JailBreak: Unknown’s Cut release on Workshop","title":"Release of JailBreak: Unknown's Cut","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 грудня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/s8cli/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"S8cli","type":"authors"},{"content":" Dear Alium members, another year has come to an end.

On December 5, the map ttt_null_rpg_v1 was ultimately published in the Steam Workshop.\nDuring the creation of the map, there were, of course, inevitable difficulties, primarily stemming from the limited experience of a large part of the team with the Hammer Editor. However, after some time, this issue was resolved. The map is not a complex project, as its creation took 25 days (although it could have been completed in two weeks) and was primarily designed for events related to Trouble in Terrorist Town within local circles.\nThe map essentially represents a closed, looping system with three rooms and one large tunnel running diagonally across the map. Each sector was created by a different member of Polygon 53 and features a distinct color palette and atmosphere. In other words, these can be considered liminal spaces.\nttt_null_rpg_v1 — Map in Workshop\n","date":"7 грудня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/alium-members-are-once-again-engaging-in-nonsense/","section":"Posts","summary":"The release of TTT Null RPG","title":"Alium Members Are Once Again Engaging in Nonsense...

The Staryy Steam team, consisting of three developers, made significant efforts to bring this experimental concept to life within a month, focusing on battles against bots.\nIt is important to note that this map was specifically designed for PVE (player versus environment), which excludes the possibility of balanced gameplay in a standard team deathmatch. However, there are plans to potentially release a separate version of the map for PVP, which could be played in other modes.\nAll the intended aspects of the map have been successfully implemented, making it ready for play. However, further changes may be made after the first public games to improve and refine the map.\nThe importance of this project has been demonstrated by its speed, showing that three developers can create twelve Team Deathmatch maps in a year.

Analyzing the long-term consequences of the events related to the Soripov Plan, both negative and positive changes can be noted two years after the plan\u0026rsquo;s conclusion and the release of a video on how developers confront the community.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to point out that the issue of low-quality guides remains and has even worsened. This is not specifically related to Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod players; it is a general trend across all Steam games. From this perspective, the foundation of the plan\u0026rsquo;s idea has failed, as the rules were meant to promote quality content in the guides section and filter out poor content. There is still a lot of bad content and a significant amount of meme posts. This is a problem.\nOn the other hand, when analyzing the long-term effects on the guide rules, a positive trend can be observed. Over the past year, the rule prohibiting the use of the secret phrase \u0026ldquo;Bloxwich\u0026rdquo; in achievements was removed. This is the only positive change, bringing the total number of rules down to three, which unfortunately are still not being enforced.\nRubat, the sole developer of the game, currently faces mixed criticism from both players and developers. It is unlikely that we can expect more effective management of the rules from him in the near future. However, a future update is expected to be decent due to the changes that have emerged in the beta branch before October.\nThe Soripov Protocol, two years after the conclusion of the plan, will be published as a separate discussion in the Hudson Archive.\nRules, servers, and workshop in 2023 — Publication in the community on YouTube Soripov Protocol — Publication in the Hudson Archive\n","date":"15 жовтня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/two-years-after-the-soripov-plan/","section":"Posts","summary":"Analysis of the consequences of the SORIP plan","title":"Two Years After the Soripov Plan","type":"posts"},{"content":" Every Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod player has at least once encountered such an item as a Toolgun, a universal thing that no game session can be complete without. Of course, players had a lot of questions about the functions of this tool, but still, few people asked themselves who is the creator of the Toolgun model that has been present in the game since 2005.\nDav0r (Dave Hunt) is an old member of the community who created many models, half of which were later included in the original version of the game. Toolgun, dynamite, hoverball, camera and many other models were created by this modeler. Dav0r was a rather open personality and left behind a large online footprint in the form of his Twitter, Twitch and Artstation accounts. Until recently, his personality was not so popular until the news of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s death was released on the official Discord server of Facepunch on Saturday, the sixteenth. Surprisingly, a day after the news broke, his friend Richter Overtime posted on Twitter that he had been trying to contact Dav0r for a year, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t responded.\nDave Hunt retained the authorship of many models, half of which were later used by Harry Newman in the development of the game. According to some of Dav0r\u0026rsquo;s acquaintances, he was a rather positive and calm person who was not noticed in toxic behavior\nHis death brought him popularity not only in the English-speaking community, but also in the Russian-speaking community.

This event could have been just another unremarkable occurrence; however, that day was destined to become significant in the history of the Alium community due to heated discussions and the resonance of the situation.\nBy the evening, towards the end of the event, it was established that s4molet1k had an unfair advantage over other players by using cheating programs or files that assisted with aiming and provided the exact locations of other players on the map. After presenting evidence and having a clarifying conversation in a private chat with s4molet1k, all of his rights as an official and organizer were revoked. In an attempt to rehabilitate himself, he submitted a request for restoration to be removed from the general ban list by paying a fine, but it was ultimately rejected due to the high amounts involved. Following the restoration review, a sanction was created to block his request, which did not take effect immediately due to a lack of necessary votes.\nAs a result, the Alium community lost an organizer, an official, and a potential developer. The reputation of s4molet1k plummeted, and numerous disputes arose within the Alium community regarding the position of his friend Raineronus 7-8 in the group. Questions also emerged about who should bear responsibility, the necessity of punishing Polygon officer Gunter, and the future of the division itself. Unfortunately, this event left the Polygon division in a dire state, with only one moderator and officer remaining.\nThree weeks after the main events, on the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch server run by Flammable, better known by his real name—Mikhail Belyaev—s4molet1k was caught cheating again. This incident reached the Alium community, reigniting the excitement around the situation, but this time it extended beyond Garry’s Mod. Following this, a renewed community sanction was written to block the restoration request, which was successful, and the fine for unbanning was increased.

It can be assumed that the players of AliumGM, who were friends of Yaroslav, the creator of the first Alium server, represented some sort of unorganized group of friends even before the server opened. However, this is largely irrelevant now, as their decisions do not impact the current or future situation in Alium.\nFive years is a convenient milestone for the present, as no one has been in the community for more than five years prior to the creation of the first server. Only a few players remain from that time, and they won\u0026rsquo;t have much to share.

Despite expressions of disappointment, most users were indifferent, as the server had remained empty for a long time, and interest in the project had waned among the majority of players.\nFor several years, OctoGames occupied a gaming niche for fans of non-roleplay modes, gathering them under the community of servers from Octothorp Team. At one time, a significant number of players enjoyed OctoGames, but they have all since moved on. New players found it uninteresting. The project administration also showed little interest. As one player described the situation: \u0026ldquo;Zero updates, zero fixes, zero administrators.\u0026rdquo;\nDue to the low online presence, which only occasionally peaked on weekends, the administrators lost motivation to maintain the server. This is supported by statistics from server monitoring websites and the lack of new topics on the forum. Developers also saw no reason to support a barely alive project. Occasionally, interest in the server was rekindled thanks to updates from Wani4ka and QURS. However, after the developers left, player interest in the project nearly vanished.\nIt is worth noting that OctoGames received virtually no advertising and was little known outside the Octothorp Team community. For many, OctoGames was simply a break from Dobrogorod. Additionally, the project was uncompetitive compared to other servers due to the lack of unique elements that could keep players engaged for an extended period. The game modes were standard with only minor changes.

This summer, the story is repeating itself, albeit on a smaller scale.\nAs usual, it was initially difficult to determine which add-on was triggering the screamer, but eventually, all signs pointed to the workshop publications of Albert Wesker, as all items in his workshop had updates corresponding to the morning of June 9th.\nAccording to subscribers of the workshop, the infected add-ons initiate the appearance of the screamer through a script that activates when the player moves. There is no information regarding data loss, publication of personal information, or damage to the game or computer. Subscribers to the add-ons can simply experience a fright. Strangely enough, the problem can be resolved by simply unsubscribing from the add-ons in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop.\nAlthough there is no rule in the \u0026ldquo;Our Rules\u0026rdquo; section of the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod Wiki that prohibits the addition of screamers to add-ons, Rubat has been informed about the potential violations in Albert Wesker\u0026rsquo;s workshop. The community is currently well aware of the changes to the add-ons due to significant media reaction.\nSteam moderators, citing Steam ToS rules, may consider such changes in an add-on as trolling and could block the workshop without any action from the Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod developers.\nThe consequences could lead to a humorous reaction from the community, similar to the larger version that occurred last summer.

The main event was the departure of Flashar from the position of officer, followed by the disbandment of the \u0026ldquo;Center\u0026rdquo; division and the creation of the \u0026ldquo;Polygon 53\u0026rdquo; division, with Gunter as its officer.\nOn April 20th, the project work on the Monty Hall paradox in TTT conditions was completed. The results have not yet been published. Additionally, this month, the collection of icons for various maps for Pika Software was finalized.\nOn April 21st, an update for Alium Nook was released. Some areas on the map were edited to allow players to hide while playing Zombie Plague. A fix was added to prevent doors from being blocked.\nThree gatherings were held this spring: on March 30th, April 27th, and May 27th. For detailed information, you can review the transcripts in the discussions of the Hudson Archive. After the gathering on April 27th, work began on Alium Course, which is being handled by Sereganeon and SoR_Ge.\nOn May 6th, the Lakursky Court was held regarding the extension of Community Sanctions, resulting in several amendments to the concept without any deletions.\nThroughout its existence, the \u0026ldquo;Center\u0026rdquo; has achieved decent results. In 2022, a PRiPIR authored by Gunter was conducted, which resulted in the completion of the minimum planned work. On May 7th, a tournament for CSS was organized by Flashar. For some time, at various periods, the \u0026ldquo;Center\u0026rdquo; division had a server in Left 4 Dead 2, and the host was launched twice in CSS and Minecraft.\nTranscript of the April gathering — Publication in the Hudson Archive Transcript of the May gathering — Publication in the Hudson Archive Spam doors — Publication in the Hudson Archive Alium Nook — Current concept\n","date":"28 травня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/spring-2023-changes-and-results-of-the-center/","section":"Posts","summary":"Officer transitions, divisions reorganized.","title":"Spring 2023: Changes and Results of the Center","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 травня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ru/tags/%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Локальщина","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 травня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ru/tags/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Новости","type":"tags"},{"content":"On April 19th, the well-known developer Garry Newman posted a poll on Twitter regarding the necessity of removing Nazi-themed game modes from the browser servers of Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod. Unsurprisingly, the majority of respondents voted for removal. This event is noteworthy primarily because it pertains to Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod, which is not a common topic for Garry, as his Twitter content usually revolves around S\u0026amp;Box or his personal life.\nThe following day, April 20th, Garry published another post, this time without a poll, but with a detailed explanation of the situation. In short, Garry decided to raise the issue of Nazism on certain roleplay servers, mainly those themed around World War II. He noted that there are players on such servers who, as he put it, seem to really like Nazis, and some of them appear to carry those sentiments beyond the game. He is also concerned about what this could lead to for both regular players and server owners.\nAt the end of the post, Newman stated that they would not impose total control over servers or dictate the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; thoughts to players; rather, such servers would be shut down as they had been in the past. He made an announcement to all server owners, asking how he could begin working with them to avoid potential server bans.\nAccording to Garry, he has begun to view this situation differently than he did ten years ago. He now has a daughter and a son who play games, and like him, they learn new things about the world through them. He is very concerned about what such servers might teach others. This could be a hint that rules for server owners may indeed tighten, and there will be more detailed oversight.\nIt is likely that the community will see fewer such players over time, not only on World War II servers but possibly on other large and small projects as well. These individuals not only irritate others with their antics but also behave immorally, damaging the reputation of not just the servers but the entire gaming community.\nWe may be facing some changes ahead; this issue might not only affect World War II servers but could extend to other areas as well. All we can do now is to refrain from behaving in such a manner.\nGarry Newman\u0026rsquo;s post with a survey Garry Newman\u0026rsquo;s post with explanations Sereganeon retains authorship of the article\n","date":"21 квітня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/garry-is-banning-servers-again/","section":"Posts","summary":"Garry’s Mod bans Nazi content.","title":"Garry Newman is Banning Servers Again","type":"posts"},{"content":"My name is Sergey.

This is a unique event in the Source games, as it marks the first time (excluding Dota 2) that a game has been fully transitioned from Source to Source 2.\nThis transition sheds light on some misconceptions surrounding how game engines work and how games are ported to new versions of these engines. It is common in the community to hear the belief that no one is interested in modifying Source because its code is considered outdated. However, those who support this view often overlook the fact that there are currently very few games on the market that use the original engine. Most new engines are essentially rewritten versions of older ones.\nSource 2 is no exception to this rewriting trend. It is a new version of Source that is based on the code of the old engine, which, interestingly, was once based on GoldSrc. Observing this event can serve as a lesson for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod.\nIt is important to note that the port of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to the new engine occurred not primarily because the developers have a deep love for their game. It happened due to commercial conditions that constrained the possibility of releasing a new game in the series. Financial gain is a priority when deciding whether to port a game to a new engine or create a new game on a new engine. A similar issue has arisen with Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod 2, which is now called S\u0026amp;Box.\nAfter the release of Counter-Strike 2, we should recognize why Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod was not updated to Source 2, and instead, we are receiving a completely different game on the same engine. This is due to the absence of in-game transactions or any additional financial incentives for the developers. While the old code presents challenges for updates, it is not a fundamental barrier that should doom the game.\nThe future of updates for Garry\u0026rsquo;s Mod remains uncertain due to the priorities of the Facepunch developers. We can only hope that Garry Newman\u0026rsquo;s words in an interview with PC Gamer—that the game will be updated as long as people continue to play it—were not a lie.\nErick_Malsimets retains authorship of the article.\n","date":"30 березня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/counter-strike-2-in-the-context-of-garrys-mod-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Counter-Strike 2 engine transition explained.","title":"Counter-Strike 2 in the Context of Garry's Mod 2","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 березня 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ru/tags/%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Глобальщина","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 березня 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/alium/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Alium","type":"tags"},{"content":" The latest private project work of the community The Alium has come to an end.

Члени спільноти — талановиті люди, які пишуть доповіді на основі ігрових тем, знімають аналітичні відео та машиніми, пишуть рецензії, створюють і модифікують ігрові режими, створюють карти, організовують турніри і беруть у них участь.\nАліумська спільнота має велику задокументовану спадщину у вигляді публікацій в майстерні, аналітичних або смішних відео на YouTube, а також безліч постів в обговореннях і оголошеннях в групі Steam.\nОрганізація групи визначається детально розписаними актуальними концепціями і ділить спільноту на підрозділи. «ЯК ГРАТИ З ВАМИ?» # «ЯК ГРАТИ З ВАМИ?» : щоб грати з нами, ви можете приєднатися до наших подій просто через браузер серверів. Щоб отримувати сповіщення про те, коли починається гра, достатньо зайти на Discord-сервер спільноти і звертати увагу на сповіщення в каналі #events.*\n«ЯК ПРИЄДНАТИСЯ ДО ВАС?» # «ЯК ПРИЄДНАТИСЯ ДО ВАС?» : офіційне членство в групі настає після того, як вашу заявку в Steam групу схвалили.* Для того, щоб вступити до групи, вам потрібно 100 годин в Garry’s Mod, відкритий і презентабельний профіль, відсутність зв\u0026rsquo;язків з персонами нон грата, відсутність блокувань в спільному банлисті. Після прийняття у вас з\u0026rsquo;являється можливість заходити на збори, брати участь у турнірах, коментувати публікації, голосувати в санкціях спільноти тощо. За додатковою інформацією зверніться до технічного аккаунту.*\n«ЯК ОТРИМАТИ РОЗБАН?» # «ЯК ОТРИМАТИ РОЗБАН?» : в групі реалізовано правило, що якщо гравець отримав перманентне блокування на серверах наших друзів, то це блокування автоматично переноситься в Аліумську спільноту і визнається правомірним. Зняти бан можна, домовившись із сервером, на якому вас забанили, або ж сплативши штраф безпосередньо в Аліумській спільноті.
