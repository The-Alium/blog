Garry's Mod continues to maintain a standard of 1-2 updates per year. The first update of 2025 will be released on March 26.

The game has received numerous changes related to Portal 2: many entities have been added, player spawn points have been placed on cooperative maps, and icons for each map have been introduced. The NPC tab now includes hacked and harmless ball mines, as well as a hostile rebel, which serves as an example for developers. At the request of the developers, Klaus Veen's Treason has been integrated, allowing content from their game to be embedded in Garry's Mod. A button has been added to the console that enables the technical display of various elements, such as the game interface.

For developers, the toolkit has been expanded with 14 new entities, and 4 entities have been updated, most of which were taken from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2. Numerous changes related to shaders and sounds have been introduced. In the Hammer Editor, the limit for brushes has been increased from 16,384 to 65,535, and some commands for the compiler have been added. Now, by default, all content from the "addons" folder is mounted in the Hammer Editor and can be disabled with the command "-noaddons." One of the most significant technical changes in the entire March update is the restoration of the "JellyFish" shader.

This is not the complete list of changes in the March update. A comprehensive list of both technical innovations and improvements visible directly in the game can be found on the Facepunch page. However, it is unlikely that these fixes go beyond the usual Quality of Life improvements.
