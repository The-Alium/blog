Five years have passed since the creation of the first Alium server, the opening of which marked the beginning of the well-known Alium story. In reality, there are no exact dates for the community's emergence, as it was not a one-time unilateral decision made by some ephemeral community manager. It can be assumed that the players of AliumGM, who were friends of Yaroslav, the creator of the first Alium server, represented some sort of unorganized group of friends even before the server opened. However, this is largely irrelevant now, as their decisions do not impact the current or future situation in Alium.

Five years is a convenient milestone for the present, as no one has been in the community for more than five years prior to the creation of the first server. Only a few players remain from that time, and they won't have much to share. I can only say that it was simply enjoyable for me to return to my computer in the evenings after school, university, or work to spend a few hours of my life at a chaotic party in the Garry's Mod community of people I didn't know.

To celebrate the five-year anniversary, a gathering will be organized that will bring some changes to the structure of the group. In a few days or weeks, another announcement will be made with the results of the implementation of the changes proposed at the gathering. I will also publish updated descriptions of the portraits on Alium Nook along with previously unpublished diagrams. You will be able to find them there as well.
