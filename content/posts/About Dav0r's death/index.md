Every Garry's Mod player has at least once encountered such an item as a Toolgun, a universal thing that no game session can be complete without. Of course, players had a lot of questions about the functions of this tool, but still, few people asked themselves who is the creator of the Toolgun model that has been present in the game since 2005.

Dav0r (Dave Hunt) is an old member of the community who created many models, half of which were later included in the original version of the game. Toolgun, dynamite, hoverball, camera and many other models were created by this modeler. Dav0r was a rather open personality and left behind a large online footprint in the form of his Twitter, Twitch and Artstation accounts. Until recently, his personality was not so popular until the news of Dav0r's death was released on the official Discord server of Facepunch on Saturday, the sixteenth. Surprisingly, a day after the news broke, his friend Richter Overtime posted on Twitter that he had been trying to contact Dav0r for a year, but he hadn't responded.

Dave Hunt retained the authorship of many models, half of which were later used by Harry Newman in the development of the game. According to some of Dav0r's acquaintances, he was a rather positive and calm person who was not noticed in toxic behavior

His death brought him popularity not only in the English-speaking community, but also in the Russian-speaking community. Before this news, most users did not even know about Dav0r as a model creator, let alone his personality. Hezzy said in the main post from Facepunch that the wake would be held on October 3 in Ulverston.
