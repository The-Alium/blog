On June 14th, the Discord server OctoGames, owned by Wani4ka, announced the closure of the OctoGames gaming server. Despite expressions of disappointment, most users were indifferent, as the server had remained empty for a long time, and interest in the project had waned among the majority of players.

For several years, OctoGames occupied a gaming niche for fans of non-roleplay modes, gathering them under the community of servers from Octothorp Team. At one time, a significant number of players enjoyed OctoGames, but they have all since moved on. New players found it uninteresting. The project administration also showed little interest. As one player described the situation: "Zero updates, zero fixes, zero administrators."

Due to the low online presence, which only occasionally peaked on weekends, the administrators lost motivation to maintain the server. This is supported by statistics from server monitoring websites and the lack of new topics on the forum. Developers also saw no reason to support a barely alive project. Occasionally, interest in the server was rekindled thanks to updates from Wani4ka and QURS. However, after the developers left, player interest in the project nearly vanished.

It is worth noting that OctoGames received virtually no advertising and was little known outside the Octothorp Team community. For many, OctoGames was simply a break from Dobrogorod. Additionally, the project was uncompetitive compared to other servers due to the lack of unique elements that could keep players engaged for an extended period. The game modes were standard with only minor changes. The only thing that could briefly captivate players was ChopChop with its mechanics, but even that gameplay was only entertaining for 2-3 evenings before it quickly became tiresome.
