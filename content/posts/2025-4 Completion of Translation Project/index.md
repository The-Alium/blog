With the beginning of the anglicization process of the Alium community, there arose a need to translate announcements and current concepts in the Steam group. In this regard, on March 1st, a translation project was initiated, resulting in all announcements and articles being translated into English. The current concepts were codified, took on a slightly different form, and were also fully translated into English.

In keeping with the promises made at the Lacour Court, which took place at the end of December 2024, the original reports and current concepts remain in Russian. Duplicate announcements in English will be included in the new guide. Translations of the current concepts will be found in the comments under the originals.

The authorship of the project is retained by Winterskin, Sereganeon, and Erick_Maksimets. Temporarily active participants in the project were s8cli and DenDi85. Inactive participants included Doresun, Dies, and Entary.

A special thanks to our Persona Grata, Hudson633, for helping to verify the accuracy of the report translations.
