On November 12, a group of volunteers from the Polygon 53 division was assembled, which set itself the task of creating a rather unusual local map for the community, with four people participating in its creation. On December 5, the map ttt_null_rpg_v1 was finally published on Steam Workshop.

Of course, there were some difficulties in creating the map, mainly due to the lack of experience with Hammer Editor among most of the team, but after some time, this problem was solved. The map is not a complex project, as it took 25 days to create (although it could have been done in two weeks), and was made primarily for Trouble in Terrorist Town events in local circles.

The map is essentially a closed, looped system with three rooms and one large tunnel diagonally across the map. Each sector was created by a separate member of Polygon 53 and has a different color scheme and atmosphere. In other words, they can be considered liminal spaces.
