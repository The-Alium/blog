Thanks to the efforts of the new forces within the **Alium community**, the extensive restoration and publication project for **Counter-Strike Source** maps has allowed us to settle outstanding debts from old publications and create five new ones. All discovered maps underwent balance checks and received new designs for the Steam workshop.

With the completion of this plan, the **Alium community** now has access to a new branch of **PORiPAK** — the ZPB Marathon. Essentially, this is the same calculation from **PORiPAK**, but it will be a marathon covering all publications that will take place after significant changes in the balance of the game mode itself.

Will there be a repeat of **PORiPAK**? — Possibly, in a few months. One of the PORiPAK publications made it to the TOP of the **Garry's Mod** workshop, which provided a nice boost to its statistics.
