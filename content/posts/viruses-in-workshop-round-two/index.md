Last summer, the workshop saw changes to many popular add-ons that introduced unauthorized screamers into the game. This summer, the story is repeating itself, albeit on a smaller scale.

As usual, it was initially difficult to determine which add-on was triggering the screamer, but eventually, all signs pointed to the workshop publications of Albert Wesker, as all items in his workshop had updates corresponding to the morning of June 9th.

According to subscribers of the workshop, the infected add-ons initiate the appearance of the screamer through a script that activates when the player moves. There is no information regarding data loss, publication of personal information, or damage to the game or computer. Subscribers to the add-ons can simply experience a fright. Strangely enough, the problem can be resolved by simply unsubscribing from the add-ons in Albert Wesker's workshop.

Although there is no rule in the "Our Rules" section of the Garry's Mod Wiki that prohibits the addition of screamers to add-ons, Rubat has been informed about the potential violations in Albert Wesker's workshop. The community is currently well aware of the changes to the add-ons due to significant media reaction.

Steam moderators, citing Steam ToS rules, may consider such changes in an add-on as trolling and could block the workshop without any action from the Garry's Mod developers.

The consequences could lead to a humorous reaction from the community, similar to the larger version that occurred last summer. No negative repercussions are expected from such a trivial stunt. You can check the status of the workshop's blocking through the links below.
