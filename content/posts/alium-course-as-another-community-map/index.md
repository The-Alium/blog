Recently, a group of mappers from Alium completed their project work on creating a community map intended for testing the skills of candidates for active roles. Initially, the map was conceived as less absurd, but as the level of madness increased during development, it turned into a map filled with local humor that would deter any random players from attempting to complete it.

Yesterday, all major work on the map was either completed or put on hold, so the project work on the map development is considered finished.

The preparation took a lot of time due to the recruitment of mappers and the establishment of standards starting from the end of April. By the beginning of May, the map was already in development and was released to celebrate the community's five-year anniversary. In total, three months were spent on the project.
