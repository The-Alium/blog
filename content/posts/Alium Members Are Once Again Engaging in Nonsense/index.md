On November 12, a group of volunteers from the "Polygon 53" division was assembled with the goal of creating a rather unusual local map for the community, involving the participation of four individuals. On December 5, the map ttt_null_rpg_v1 was ultimately published in the Steam Workshop.

During the creation of the map, there were, of course, inevitable difficulties, primarily stemming from the limited experience of a large part of the team with the Hammer Editor. However, after some time, this issue was resolved. The map is not a complex project, as its creation took 25 days (although it could have been completed in two weeks) and was primarily designed for events related to Trouble in Terrorist Town within local circles.

The map essentially represents a closed, looping system with three rooms and one large tunnel running diagonally across the map. Each sector was created by a different member of Polygon 53 and features a distinct color palette and atmosphere. In other words, these can be considered liminal spaces.
