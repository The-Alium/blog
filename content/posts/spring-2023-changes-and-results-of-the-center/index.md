Throughout the spring, numerous changes and events occurred, evenly distributed over the time period. The main event was the departure of Flashar from the position of officer, followed by the disbandment of the "Center" division and the creation of the "Polygon 53" division, with Gunter as its officer.

On April 20th, the project work on the Monty Hall paradox in TTT conditions was completed. The results have not yet been published. Additionally, this month, the collection of icons for various maps for Pika Software was finalized.

On April 21st, an update for Alium Nook was released. Some areas on the map were edited to allow players to hide while playing Zombie Plague. A fix was added to prevent doors from being blocked.

Three gatherings were held this spring: on March 30th, April 27th, and May 27th. For detailed information, you can review the transcripts in the discussions of the Hudson Archive. After the gathering on April 27th, work began on Alium Course, which is being handled by Sereganeon and SoR_Ge.

On May 6th, the Lakursky Court was held regarding the extension of Community Sanctions, resulting in several amendments to the concept without any deletions.

Throughout its existence, the "Center" has achieved decent results. In 2022, a PRiPIR authored by Gunter was conducted, which resulted in the completion of the minimum planned work. On May 7th, a tournament for CSS was organized by Flashar. For some time, at various periods, the "Center" division had a server in Left 4 Dead 2, and the host was launched twice in CSS and Minecraft.
