Hello, you are reading a text written by Erick_Maksimets, and I have returned for the second time. I would like to make a couple of changes and outline some modifications to the group that are gradually coming into effect with my new officer term.

For the first time in the Alium community, in October 2025, we are seeing a management situation where the community has formed three divisions: Starry Steam, Renaissance, and Pika Software as an external division with a special status. Now, to make changes in the group, we need the consent of at least two officers from the existing divisions. Overall, this situation could serve as an interesting experiment and a practical test of the community-building concepts, which described the rules of conduct in such a situation quite concisely, and it also looks like an endgame before the end of the world and an inspiring beginning at the same time.

Now, at meetings, we will be evaluating the polarization of controversial opinions. If you used to attend meetings to have talking heads tell you interesting things about Garry's Mod while you were cooking in the kitchen, you can now approach the computer for a minute to cast a vote and, based on that vote, determine the community's opinion.

We have made quite a few cosmetic changes to the Discord server and are also experimenting with its appearance there. Before that, we updated the posts in the Hudson Archive. Soon, we will try to implement the concept of a warning system into the community rules.

Before this, we had a lot of interesting events happen over the past couple of months. Especially in August, which marked the seventh anniversary of the creation of the first community server, but the August events, as is tradition, were remembered for a cheater who was once in a moderator position with us, trying to clear his name and, having gained our trust, unexpectedly and honestly held a tournament for his game mode — Serious Deathmatch. But that is already old news, so it's better to talk about work.

The work of the Old Steam division will be focused on presenting the results in the form of videos on my channel. If you are interested in digging into topics that are not very gaming-related yet but are connected to me, you can watch my latest video. My videos here will usually be attached to St. Steam's project works. The videos will be released in Ukrainian, Russian, and English.
