More than a year and a half ago, in June 2023, **Meetric** began from scratch the development and rethinking of his previous addon that added **dynamic water**. For a long time, the progress of the development was regularly published on his YouTube channel, and access to the early version was provided through **Patreon and Boosty**. On January 11th, 2025, the final version of **GWater 2** was released in the workshop.

**GWater 2** completely surpasses the previous addon in all parameters. Now liquids don't look like a multitude of mixing squares, but like more realistic individual drops that can seamlessly merge. Performance has improved, the user interface has become more pleasant and has added sounds, and there are many settings, the ability to save presets, etc.

With each new demonstration of developments and publication of addons in the workshop, **Meetric** continues to prove himself as an extremely promising and authoritative developer. The publication of his latest magnum opus in such a short time also shows him to be an honest person who does not intend to endlessly extract money from his platforms. It's also worth noting that in the development of **GWater 2**, **Meetric** was assisted not only financially but also with specific contributions and code. All the credits for those who helped in any way are listed in the addon menu.
