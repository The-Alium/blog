Almost a year ago, on November 19th, 2023, the first part of **Half-Life** celebrated it's **25th anniversary**. In honor of this, **Valve** created a special online page, released a global update for the game, and published a **documentary**. On November 16th, 2024, **Half-Life 2** will celebrate it's **20th anniversary**, and **Valve** is following a similar celebration plan.

A global update has been released for **Half-Life 2**, changing a large number of things. Now, **Half-Life 2**, **all episodes**, and **Lost Coast** have been combined into one game and can be selected from the main menu. **Developer commentary** has been added, along with support for the **Workshop**. The game content has been updated, graphics settings improved, and performance on the **Steam Deck** enhanced. **Half-Life 2: Deathmatch** has also received some "**Quality of life**" fixes, and a complete list of changes is available on a special website dedicated to this event.

A new, expanded print edition of **Half-Life 2: Raising The Bar** has been announced. A documentary covering the entire development cycle from the creation of **Half-Life 2** to the **third episode**, featuring archival footage such as the **E3 Demo 2002**, **2003**, and the **Free TV demo**, has been released on the official YouTube channel. The official soundtrack is now available on **Steam** and other platforms.

For **Garry's Mod**, this means that when playing on the original maps, these improvements will also be present. Content from all three games, as well as **Lost Coast**, is now added after downloading **Half-Life 2** on **Steam**. Some changes from this update may be included in a future update.

A year ago, like **Half-Life**, **Counter-Strike** received an update that fixed and added many features. It was expected that **Counter-Strike: Source** would also receive some attention, as it also turned 20 years old on November 1, 2004; however, it has not received any updates.
