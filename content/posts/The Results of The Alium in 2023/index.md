Dear Alium members, another year has come to an end. This year has seen many joyful as well as sorrowful events. Numerous significant news items have been announced both within Alium and in Garry's Mod itself.

Although it is possible that nothing will change in the coming year, it is important to emphasize that we should not shy away from the opportunity to make the next year as memorable as possible in a positive way.

Today, as per our old and cherished tradition, we will release a video summarizing all the news that occurred in Alium throughout the year. This video was created with your support, for which we are grateful.

Happy New Year, dear friends! Don’t be disheartened, stay with us in the coming year!
