I want to draw your attention to the work being done to develop the game mode Half-Life: Deathmatch—specifically, the creation of a unique map that supports gameplay against bots. The Staryy Steam team, consisting of three developers, made significant efforts to bring this experimental concept to life within a month, focusing on battles against bots.

It is important to note that this map was specifically designed for PVE (player versus environment), which excludes the possibility of balanced gameplay in a standard team deathmatch. However, there are plans to potentially release a separate version of the map for PVP, which could be played in other modes.

All the intended aspects of the map have been successfully implemented, making it ready for play. However, further changes may be made after the first public games to improve and refine the map.

The importance of this project has been demonstrated by its speed, showing that three developers can create twelve Team Deathmatch maps in a year. I invite you to come and battle the bots on our map at the upcoming events hosted by Erick_Maksimets.
