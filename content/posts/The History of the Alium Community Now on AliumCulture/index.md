Hello! Today, a 50-minute video detailing the events in **the Alium community** from 2018 to the present day was released on **the AliumCulture channel**, available in **Russian**. If you are interested in **Alium** or any unconventional movements in **Garry's Mod**, this is a great way to spend an hour of your life for general knowledge.

The work on the video took about half a year in total, but the active focus on its creation began a month ago, following the onset of widespread power outages. The history of **Alium** is divided into six periods, which you can jump between using timestamps. If the earlier periods of **Alium**'s existence do not interest you, feel free to skip directly to the moderator periods. However, to maintain the narrative flow, I recommend watching the video in its entirety.

Please note that comments on **YouTube** are disabled. If you would like to discuss any aspect of the video, please leave your messages in the comments of this announcement or write in the discussion thread on our **Discord server**.
