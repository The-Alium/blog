At the beginning of August, on the third day of the month, we launched a Trouble in Terrorist Town event organized by s4molet1k for a long-term game. This event could have been just another unremarkable occurrence; however, that day was destined to become significant in the history of the Alium community due to heated discussions and the resonance of the situation.

By the evening, towards the end of the event, it was established that s4molet1k had an unfair advantage over other players by using cheating programs or files that assisted with aiming and provided the exact locations of other players on the map. After presenting evidence and having a clarifying conversation in a private chat with s4molet1k, all of his rights as an official and organizer were revoked. In an attempt to rehabilitate himself, he submitted a request for restoration to be removed from the general ban list by paying a fine, but it was ultimately rejected due to the high amounts involved. Following the restoration review, a sanction was created to block his request, which did not take effect immediately due to a lack of necessary votes.

As a result, the Alium community lost an organizer, an official, and a potential developer. The reputation of s4molet1k plummeted, and numerous disputes arose within the Alium community regarding the position of his friend Raineronus 7-8 in the group. Questions also emerged about who should bear responsibility, the necessity of punishing Polygon officer Gunter, and the future of the division itself. Unfortunately, this event left the Polygon division in a dire state, with only one moderator and officer remaining.

Three weeks after the main events, on the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch server run by Flammable, better known by his real name—Mikhail Belyaev—s4molet1k was caught cheating again. This incident reached the Alium community, reigniting the excitement around the situation, but this time it extended beyond Garry’s Mod. Following this, a renewed community sanction was written to block the restoration request, which was successful, and the fine for unbanning was increased. Just two days later, Flammable released a video dedicated to both s4molet1k and the entire situation, revealing all the details of his bans in three hours.
