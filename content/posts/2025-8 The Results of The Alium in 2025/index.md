2025 has come to an end. As is tradition, we are publishing a video report on what happened in the community during this time. The year 2025 was marked by the formation of three units within The Alium Community: Starry Steam, Renaissance, and the external division Pika Software. YouTube rolled out multi-language audio feature, making it possible to revive Starry Steam and produce videos in multiple languages. Another stage of the community’s Anglicization also took place in 2025: all current concepts and announcements received official English translations. Earlier, current concepts had also been codified and simplified.

In 2025, The Alium Community collectively logged hundreds of hours in Garry’s Mod. I hope you were part of this wonderful time, and that we’ll see each other again in 2026. More details and a selection of posts from #funny can be found on the AliumCulture channel, where you can also watch the video report.

Happy New Year!
