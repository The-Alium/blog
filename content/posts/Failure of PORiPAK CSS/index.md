Due to the lack of interest from the community in carrying out any basic group work, I am forced to announce the failure of the Project for the **Extensive Restoration and Publication of Archived Counter-Strike: Source Maps** and to begin searching for new players.

In the future, priority will be given to individual projects that will not be conducted under the auspices of the group, meaning they will be solely under my control and responsibility.

From now on, every member of the group, in every sense of the word, has no obligations. The moderator position for the system administrator has also been removed. Acknowledging the capabilities of the community, I understand that I will not be able to maintain the server. Thank you for at least taking the time to count.
