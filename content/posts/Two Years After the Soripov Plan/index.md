More than two years ago, the SORIP plan was completed, aimed at addressing mass violations in the guides section of Garry's Mod. Analyzing the long-term consequences of the events related to the Soripov Plan, both negative and positive changes can be noted two years after the plan's conclusion and the release of a video on how developers confront the community.

First and foremost, it is important to point out that the issue of low-quality guides remains and has even worsened. This is not specifically related to Garry's Mod players; it is a general trend across all Steam games. From this perspective, the foundation of the plan's idea has failed, as the rules were meant to promote quality content in the guides section and filter out poor content. There is still a lot of bad content and a significant amount of meme posts. This is a problem.

On the other hand, when analyzing the long-term effects on the guide rules, a positive trend can be observed. Over the past year, the rule prohibiting the use of the secret phrase "Bloxwich" in achievements was removed. This is the only positive change, bringing the total number of rules down to three, which unfortunately are still not being enforced.

Rubat, the sole developer of the game, currently faces mixed criticism from both players and developers. It is unlikely that we can expect more effective management of the rules from him in the near future. However, a future update is expected to be decent due to the changes that have emerged in the beta branch before October.

The Soripov Protocol, two years after the conclusion of the plan, will be published as a separate discussion in the Hudson Archive.
