My name is Sergey. I'm a mapper and a small youtuber. I'm also the current member of The Alium community, a group of friends and their friends from GMOD.

I'm not really interested in talking to you if I don't know you well, to be honest. I'm not being selfish, I just get really anxious and scared to talk to random people on the internet.
But I promise that if we hit it off, it could turn into a long-term friendship or partnership, because I'm very loyal to people who let me into their world.

If you want something from me, join The Alium's discord server, where I am mostly active 24/7. If you have something personal or just want something to be just between us, then, pls, DM me on discord so I can track our communication over time, cuz I like to forget things all the time.
